# CodeLoom

CodeLoom is an open-source tool designed to turn code into stunning, shareable visuals while adding cutting-edge features that elevate the way developers present and share their work. Unlike other tools like Ray.so, CodeLoom brings enhanced AI functionalities, complete customization, and interactivity to the forefront.

## Why I Built CodeLoom

As a developer, I’ve always appreciated tools like Ray.so for their ability to turn code into beautiful, shareable visuals. But as I used it more, I started noticing the gaps—features that could make the experience even better. Ray.so is great, but I wanted something more—a tool that brings creativity, intelligence, and functionality together in one seamless package.

That’s where CodeLoom comes in.

## Key Features

### AI-Enhanced Comments
Have you ever shared a snippet only to realize later you should’ve added more context? Ray.so doesn’t help with that. CodeLoom fills this gap by integrating an AI agent that generates meaningful comments for your code. Whether you’re a teacher explaining concepts or a developer showcasing your work, this feature ensures your code tells the full story.

### AI Code Generation
Sometimes you’re stuck at the “what if?” stage. What if I had a snippet to demonstrate this idea? Or how can I extend this functionality? Ray.so can’t generate code, but CodeLoom can. With AI-powered snippet creation, you’re never short of ideas or examples.

### True Customization
Ray.so offers limited themes and customization. With CodeLoom, you have complete control—choose your fonts, colors, layouts, and even add interactive annotations. Your code images should reflect your style, not just the tool’s presets.

### Interactive Sharing and Collaboration
Code isn’t static, so why should your snippets be? With CodeLoom, you can annotate, highlight, and export your designs in formats that are perfect for presentations, social media, or collaborative discussions.

## The Vision Behind CodeLoom

Code is art. It’s creativity woven into logic. CodeLoom is here to honor that idea—to help developers transform their work into something not just functional, but visually and contextually compelling. I built this platform because I wanted more than just another code-sharing tool; I wanted something that could elevate the way we present, share, and celebrate the art of coding.
